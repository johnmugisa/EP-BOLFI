  <param description="Persistent record identifier." type="long" name="record" char="r" required="true"/>
  <param description="File name." type="string" name="filename" char="n" required="true"/>
  <param description="A list (give as string). Gives the location in the HDF5 file where the data table is stored. Each entry goes one level deeper into the HDF structure. Each entry can either be the index to go into next itself, or a 2-tuple or a 2-list. In the latter case, (None, x) denotes slicing[:, x] and (x, None) denotes slicing[x, :]." type="string" name="data-location" char="d" required="true"/>
  <param description="Dictionary (give as string). Its keys are the indices of the columns which are to be read in. These can also be 2-tuples for slicing; '(x, None)' or '(None, x)' get translated to slicing with [x, :] or [:, x]. The default behaviour for integer indices x is the same as '(None, x)', slicing the column x. The corresponding values are there to tell this function which kind of data is in which column. The following format has to be used: '&lt;name&gt; [&lt;unit&gt;]' where 'name' is 'U' (voltage), 'I' (current) or 't' (time) and 'unit' is 'V', 'A', 'h', 'm' or 's' with the optional prefixes 'k', 'm', 'µ' or 'n'. This converts the data to prefix-less SI units. For impedance data, 'name' is 'f' (frequency), 'real_Z' (real part of impedance), 'imag_Z' (imaginary part of impedance), or 'ϕ' (phase), and 'unit' is 'Hz', 'Ω', 'rad', or 'deg'. The same prefixes as before can be used to convert the data to prefix-less SI units. Additional columns may be read in with keys not in this format." type="string" name="headers" char="h" required="true"/>
  <param description="Type of the measurement, which determines the internal format for further processing. 'cycling' refers to Cycling_Information, 'static' to Static_Information' and 'impedance' to Impedance_Information. If you are unsure which to pick, consult the package documentation." type="string" name="datatype" char="y" default="cycling"/>
  <param description="A list (give as string), with the same format as 'data_location'. It points to the part of the data that stores the index of the current segment. If it changes from one data point to the next, that is used as the dividing line between two segments." type="string" name="segment-location" char="s"/>
  <param description="A list of indices which give the segments that shall be processed. Default is None, i.e., the whole file gets processed." type="long" name="segments-to-process" char="m"/>
  <param description="Dictionary (give as string). Its keys are the strings used in the file to indicate a state. The column from which this state is retrieved is given by #correction-location. The dictionaries' values are used to correct/normalize the current value in the file." type="string" name="current-sign-correction" char="c" default="{}"/>
  <param description="A list, with the same format as 'data_location'. For its use, see 'current_sign_correction'. Default: None." type="string" name="correction-location" char="o"/>
  <param description="Defaults to False, where measured voltage remains unaltered. Change to True if the voltage shall be multiplied by -1. Also applies to impedances; real and imaginary parts." type="bool" name="flip-voltage-sign" char="v" default="false"/>
  <param description="Defaults to False, where measured impedance remains unaltered. Change to True if the imaginary part of the impedance shall be multiplied by -1. Cancels out with 'flip-voltage-sign'." type="bool" name="flip-imaginary-impedance-sign" char="f" default="false"/>
