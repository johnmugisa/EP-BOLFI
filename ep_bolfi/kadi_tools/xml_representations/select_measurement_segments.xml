  <param description="The segments that get selected from the dataset. Give as a list of 2-tuples and 3-tuples, e.g., '[(0, 2), (3, 20, 2)]'. Each tuple denotes one range of segments of the dataset to return. The 2-tuples give the range as in Python's [x:y] slice notation, i.e., they refer to segments x through y - 1, counting from 0. Use 'None' to count to the end of the data including the last segment.
